   program surface_interp
!
!  Description:
!
!     Original:
!        Read a structured surface dataset (Tecplot ASCII) and a second target
!        dataset of one or more zones (possibly unstructured points in a simpler
!        format).  Interpolate the first dataset at each target point and save
!        results as a Tecplot file and (for the simpler target format) as a
!        tabulation for possible pasting into a spreadsheet.  The output file(s)
!        may contain just a subset of the input functions.
!
!     Current:
!        Interpolate within a surface dataset at the points of a second dataset.
!        Both datasets may be one of these choices:
!           Tecplot/structured, Tecplot unstructured (tri or quad cells), Plot3D
!        The target points may also be a simple list of (x,y,z) coordinates.
!        The interpolated results match the format of the target dataset, with
!        any subset of the input functions being output.
!
!  Strategy:
!
!     The ADT (Alternating Digital Tree) search technique employed always finds
!     the point not outside the surface grid being searched that is nearest to
!     the target point, along with corresponding interpolation coefficients for
!     use within the relevant cell.  Thus, extrapolation is not an option, so
!     the target points are assumed to be on or very close to the surface being
!     searched.
!
!  Control file format (standard input):
!
!     SURFACE_INTERP control file
!     SRL-surf.gu      ! File to interp. in (*.g[u] if Plot3D; *.f[u] assumed)
!     1                ! 1|2|3 = Plot3D|Tecplot structured|Tecplot unstructured
!     target-surf.dat  ! Target file to interpolate to
!     2                ! 1|2|3|4 = Plot3D|Tec struct.|Tec unstruct.|(x,y,z) list
!     Subset of functions in output file(s):
!     1 2 3
!     SRL.interp.dat   ! Plottable results; *.f[u] if Plot3D target grid
!     SRL.interp.txt   ! Tabulated results (target mode 4 only)
!     F                ! Interpolation details at initial target point?
!     2                ! 1|2 = BLOCK|POINT order output
!     0.779347  0.     ! X & F to use for x > X
!
!  Random target points format (mode 4):
!
!     x1   y1   z1   Body point 1       ! Any string may follow the coordinates
!     x2   y2   z2   Body point 2       ! else x is inserted as a tag
!     x3   y3   z3   Wing point 1
!     :    :    :    :
!
!  Tabulated output format (mode 1):
!
!     x1   y1   z1   f11  f41  f21  Body point 1 (or x1)  Min. distance
!     x2   y2   z2   f12  f42  f22  Body point 2 (or x2)    "      "
!     x3   y3   z3   f13  f43  f23  Wing point 1 (or x3)    "      "

!  History:
!
!     07/31/05  D.A.Saunders  Initial implementation, adapted from BUMP_FACTORS
!                             in a hurry during Discovery's return to flight.
!     08/12/05    "    "      Random target points may now be read from a simple
!                             list rather than requiring Tecplot format.  The
!                             smooth/damage nomenclature has been changed to
!                             surface/target.
!     12/04/05    "    "      Added optional X and F to deal with radiative
!                             heating that goes to zero beyond some X for CEV.
!     10/04/06    "    "      Installed Tecplot 360 version of the I/O package.
!     10/30/06    "    "      Turned on verbose Tecplot I/O after a mystery
!                             showed up reading output from BLAYER.
!     11/01/06    "    "      Avoid blank zone titles for unlabeled target pts.
!     11/03/06    "    "      For the random points input case, write the
!                             plottable results as a single (n,1,1) zone rather
!                             than one zone per point.
!     03/26/07    "    "      Todd White asked for minimum distances to be added
!                             to the tabulation for the list-of-points case.
!     05/02/07    "    "      The mean squared minimum distance didn't have npts
!                             inside the square root.
!     02/05/14    "    "      All ADT variants are now in a single module with
!                             generic build_adt and search_adt interfaces.
!     05/20/22    "    "      Redesigned the control file to handle all of the
!                             likely options for input surface and target data.
!     05/31/22    "    "      Finished initial rewrite.  Many permutations to
!                             test.
!     06/02/22    "    "      All options seem to be working.
