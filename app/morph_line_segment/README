   program morph_line_segment
!
!  Description:
!
!     For a given 3-space line segment, redistribute it to the desired number
!     of points by imposing the relative point distribution of a second 3-space
!     line segment via arc-length based local spline interpolation.
!     This capability facilitates deriving a new capsule generatrix with the
!     same point counts in the various segments as an existing generatrix, which
!     in turn can enable reusing computational flow field solutions as starting
!     guesses for the new geometry.
!
!     See also the earlier redistribute_xy for further line segment operations.
!
!  History:
!
!     10/03/2022  D.A.Saunders  Initial implementation, to simplify adapting the
!                               Mars SRL capsule DAC-2.1 as the similar DAC-2.
