   program wedge
!
!  Description:
!
!     For a given grid and optional flow solution in Plot2D form (as from the
!     DPLR2D solver), generate a 3D wedge form of the file(s) as needed by some
!     other flow solver such as LAURA and US3D.  Input files are prompted for
!     (no control file), as is the total wedge angle.  (The wedge is symmetric
!     about the xz plane.)  Any functions are necessarily vertex-centered.
!     Output file(s) are in Plot3D form.
!
!     The initial singular line along Ox may optionally be tweaked as two
!     separate lines either side of Ox, 2*epsilon apart, via simple y shifts.
!
!     Earlier utility DECONSTRUCT by the present author can convert the wedge
!     file(s) into unstructured form with no repeated cell vertices.  At the
!     time of writing, Tecplot form with hexahedral cells is the only option,
!     but that may be supplemented with an HDF5 output option.

!     11/23/2022  D.A.Saunders  Initial implementation following a conversation
!                               with Khalil Bensassi.
!     12/03/2022    "      "    Included an option to avoid the singular line
!                               along Ox, by simple y shifts.
