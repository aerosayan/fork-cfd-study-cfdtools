   program usreflect
!
!  Description:
!
!     This is the unstructured-grid analogue of REFLECT_BLOCKS.
!
!     Provision is made for adding file types (probably HDF5 at some point),
!     but initially, Tecplottable files that US3D can write are handled.
!
!     Like REFLECT_BLOCKS, USREFLECT reflects the zones of a multizone grid
!     in the plane specified.  Optional function data may also be reflected.
!     Either both halves or just the reflected half may be output.  If function
!     data are present, one or more quantities may have the sign changed as part
!     of the reflection.  Normally this would be just one velocity component.
!
!     The option to clean up a symmetry plane is not viable here, for lack of a
!     way of identifying the points intended to be on the symmetry plane.
!
!     A handful of prompts suffice (no control file).
!
!  Strategy:
!
!     If both halves are to be output, all zones can be read and written as is.
!     The reflected half is always written, and these zones can be derived from
!     the zones already read and stored.  So we don't need to carry around an
!     extra set of zones.
!
!  Procedures:
!
!     triangulation_io   I/O utilities for multizone unstructured datasets
!     rdlist             Utility for reading an indefinite list of integers

!  History:
!
!     08/30/05  D.A.Saunders  Initial implementation of REFLECT_BLOCKS.
!     02/23/06    "     "     Belated realization that reflecting changes the
!                             handedness.  Restore the original handedness.
