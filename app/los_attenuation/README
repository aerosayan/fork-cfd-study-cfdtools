   program los_attenuation
!
!  Description:
!
!     For the input line of sight data (los.g and los.f in Plot3D format) and
!     mission-specific radio frequency or frequencies, calculate a measure of
!     the expected radio attenuation.  The formulation used initially here is
!     that employed by program Radio_Attenuation, c. 2016, which exploited the
!     existence of a substantial aerothermal database for the Orion spacecraft.
!     It generated a secondary database for all signal directions from multiple
!     antennas.
!
!     This version can also read los.dat (point-order Tecplot file), and it
!     allows for variable function numbers for p, T, eND.

!
!  Formulation Correction From Radio_Attenuation:
!
!     03/17/2016    Rick Thompson determined that plasma frequency
!                   omegap is an angular frequency in radians/sec.
!                   Therefore, the radio frequencies should be in
!                   the same units, so multiply Hz by 2 pi.
!
!  Possible Issue:
!
!     Is this formulation Earth-specific?
!     This version includes an electron number density-only method that should
!     be applicable to any atmosphere, and is invoked via atmosphere = 'any'.

!     receiver = 'MRO'                (receiving asset; 'DTO' = direct to Earth)
!     atmosphere = 'Earth'    (any planet or 'Titan' or 'any', case-insensitive)
!     frequency  = 400.                                                    (MHz)
!     ip = 1                                    (function numbers for p, T, eND)
!     iT = 2
!     ie = 3
!     $end
!
!  LOS data:
!
!     The initial formulation expects p, T, electron number density as functions
!     1, 2, 3 in los.f, in SI units.  Any further functions will be ignored.
!     [This has now been generalized via ip, iT, ie which default to 1, 2, 3.]
!     Other forms of the attenuation calculations may require a different set of
!     functions, including eND alone.  Since a given atmosphere may be treated
!     with more than one formulation, use of a planet name to define the formu-
!     lation is problematic.
!        Suggestion:
!     Introduce names 'Earth1', 'Earth2', ... if the need arises.
!
!     Since the plottable outputs contain p and T, they should be included in
!     the LOS dataset whether the attenuation calculation uses them or now.

!     08-07-2022      "     "     Design of single-LOS adaptation.
!     08-10-2022      "     "     Allow for atmosphere specifics; initial code.
!     08-12-2022      "     "     Realized that a planet name may not be
!                                 sufficient to define what is expected in the
!                                 los.f file.  See discussion above.
!     08-17-2022      "     "     Critical density was set in the wrong place.
!                                 Allow for reading the line of sight data as a

!                                 moving a bunch of constants up to the top
!                                 level so that variations of the attenuation
!                                 formulation can share them.
