BLAYER implements a curvature-based method of determining boundary layer
edges.  This method is consistent with more standard 99.5% approaches if
the total enthalpy profile has no anomalies, and more likely to produce
a plausible result if it does.  No method is foolproof, however, so odd
results should be looked into and may be worked around with different
control inputs.

BLAYER is employed at NASA ARC in conjunction with the DPLR flow solver
and at NASA LaRC in conjunction with the LAURA flow solver.

The following description has been adapted from the header of program
BLAYER.  Please see blayer.f90 for many more details.

See also the ancillary EXTRACT_BLAYER_DATA utility, suited to extracting
(for a given surface point) the specified varaiables from a list of BLAYER
outputs that may be ordered in time, say.

Introduction:

   BLAYER reads a volume dataset from a 2-D or 3-D multiblock real gas flow

PLOT3D Input Format (ASCII or Binary):

      File pairs xxx.g/xxx.f or (preferably) xxx.gu/xxx.fu are implied if the
      control file contains (in place of a Tecplot xxx.dat input volume file)
      a file named xxx.g or xxx.gu.

      For DPLR users, the POSTFLOW file should use output format 3 and

         ivarp =  0 100 110 120     1000 150 151 [152] 132 154 50    [extras]

      for single-temperature and two-termperature solutions, respectively,
      analogous to the Tecplot format.
