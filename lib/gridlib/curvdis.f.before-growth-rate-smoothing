      SUBROUTINE CURVDIS (NDAT, XDAT, YDAT, N, POWER, ISMOOTH,
     >                    LUNOUT, ARCS_ONLY, X, Y, IER)
C
C     Acronym:  CURVature-based DIStribution (2-space)
C               ----            ---
C
C     Purpose:
C
C        CURVDIS redistributes points along a curve in 2-space which is
C     represented by a discrete dataset, not necessarily monotonic, such
C     that the local spacing is inversely proportional to the local
C     curvature (with adjustments to handle the zero curvature regions).
C     CURVDIS is intended for geometric applications where the coord-
C     inates have comparable units, although it may be used for non-
C     geometric purposes as well (e.g. plotting applications).  In both
C     cases, if the units of the curve coordinates are large (producing
C     small values of curvatures), the coordinates should be normalized
C     to the range [0,1].  For geometric curves, only one of the coord-
C     inate axes should be scaled to [0,1] and the other axis should be
C     scaled such that the true geometric shape is retained.
C
C
C     Method:
C
C        Given the availability of subroutine ARBDIS for translating
C     arbitrary "shape" functions into 1-D distributions whose spacing
C     at any abscissa is proportional to the shape function at that
C     abscissa, the problem then is to set up a shape function related
C     to curvature; ARBDIS does the rest.  (Abscissas in this case are
C     measures of arc length along the curve, and the shape function is
C     defined at each of the original data points.)
C        The subroutine is passed NDAT coordinates (XDAT, YDAT), of the
C     curve, for which it computes the cumulative arc lengths (or more
C     precisely, the cumulative chord lengths), s(n).  Next, FD12K is
C     called twice to compute the 2nd derivatives (d2x/ds2 and d2y/ds2)
C     in order to approximate the local curvatures' magnitudes, k(s),
C     which are given by:
C
C        (1)   k(s) = sqrt((d2x/ds2)**2 + (d2y/ds2)**2)
C
C        A direct inverse proportionality would yield a shape function
C     with smaller spacings in regions of larger curvature.  However,
C     for straight segments of the curve where k(s) = 0., a simple
C     inverse proportionality such as shape(s) = 1./k(s) would produce
C     an infinite local spacing.  Therefore, some arbitrary constant
C     (say 1.) should be added to k(s) in the denominator.
C        Clustering may be controlled by raising this fraction to some
C     exponent in the range [0,1].  0 would produce shape(s) = 1., or
C     uniform spacing; 1 would yield "direct" inverse proportionality
C     spacing; and an exponent in between (0,1) would produce spacings
C     between these two extremes.  Thus, our spacing function becomes:
C
C         (2)   shape(s) = [1./(k(s) + 1.)]**exponent
C
C        After the relative spacings (defining the shape function) are
C     calculated from eqn. (2), an option is provided to smooth the
C     shape function to reduce abrupt changes observed in sphere/cone
C     capsule defining sections.  The ARBDIS utility is then called to
C     compute redistributed arc lengths for the specified number N of
C     output points.  A further option is provided to smooth those
C     arc-lengths (with index-based abscissas) as also found desirable
C     for sphere/cone applications.  LCSFIT then serves to evaluate the
C     new X-Y coordinates corresponding to the new arc lengths.
C
C        Note:  The work space is used/reused in the following sequence:
C
C     (1)  WORK(1:NDAT)                 Input curve chord lengths
C     (2)  WORK(NDAT+1:2*NDAT)          FP values for FD12K calls
C     (3)  WORK(2*NDAT+1:3*NDAT)        d2x/ds2 values
C     (4)  WORK(3*NDAT+1:4*NDAT)        d2y/ds2 values
C     (5)  WORK(NDAT+1:2*NDAT)          xdat-ydat relative spacings
C                                          defining the shape function
C     (6)  WORK(2*NDAT+1:2*NDAT+N)      New curve chord lengths
C     (7)  WORK(2*NDAT+N+1:5*NDAT+6*N)  Work area used by ARBDIS
C     (8)  WORK(2*NDAT+N+1:2*NDAT+2*N)  Reused for index-based abscissas
C                                       if ARBDIS results are smoothed
C
C     Procedures:
C
C        ARBDIS           Distributes points in an interval according to an
C                         arbitrary shape function
C        FD12K            Calculates derivatives by finite differencing
C        CHORDS2D         Computes the cumulative chord lengths of a curve
C        DETECT_VERTICES  Identifies curvature spikes likely due to sharp
C                         vertices where some clustering is desirable
C        LCSFIT           Interpolates x and y to the redistributed arc
C                         lengths along the parameterized curve
C        SMOOTH1D_NITERS  Explicit smoothing utility with iteration control
C        VERTEX_CURVATURE Broadens and moderates the height of curvature spikes
