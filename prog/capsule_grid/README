CAPSULE_GRID performs automated discretization of analytically-defined
generatrices for typical (and not-so-typical) axisymmetric capsules such
as 70-degree sphere/cones with optional aft bodies.  For zero angle of
attack cases, related procedures produce the associated initial volume
grid needed for flow field calculations.  Non-analytic input generatrices
are also handled.  For angle of attack cases, a surface grid is also
produced, with the singular point region at the nose (and aft body if
present) replaced by morphed quadrant patches.  Volume grids may likewise
be produced with related procedures.

06/30/2016    "    "      A new option in CURVDIS to work with adjusted
                          curvatures that are artificially broadened onto
                          flat/low-curvature segments appears to be good
                          for analytic geometries but unreliable for input
                          generatrices of unknown quality/precision.
                          New controls flat_blend_fore & flat_blend_aft
                          allow this option to be suppressed.  It was
                          prompted by a clear need to resolve heat flux
                          spikes at the shoulder better by spreading the
                          tight shoulder grid spacing forward onto the
                          conical flank.  This should work for Apollo-
                          type spherical sections too (large radius/low
                          curvature) given that we work with normalized
                          geometry during curvature-based redistribution.
                          Namelist controls are now printed to standard
                          output.
10/27/2016    "    "      Aft-end stretching towards the symmetry axis in
                          the generatrix is undesirable.  3D surfaces
                          replace this region with uniform quadrants.
                          Therefore, do similar to the generatrix, using
                          ni_regrid_aft_body and a heuristic number of
                          uniform points at the end.
